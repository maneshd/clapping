# Maximal-ish Clapping Music

Code for a goofy version of Steve Reich's clapping music.

In the original piece, two performers each clap the same short rhythmic pattern repeatedly. One performer repeats the pattern exactly, while the other
performer shifts the pattern by one eighth note after every eight repetitions. This creates twelve different rhythmic variations before the two patterns
overlap again. For more information on the original piece, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clapping_Music.


In this version, there are twelve audio sources, each playing the clapping pattern starting on a different beat. The audio sources circle around the listener at
variable speeds, and occasionally get up close to the listener.
